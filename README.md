# Twitter Feed Mock

A Twitter-style feed mock built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project allows users to create tweets, like and retweet posts, and toggle reply visibility. All interactions update dynamically in the DOM with no backend or persistent storage.

## Features

- Post new tweets dynamically
- Like and retweet toggle functionality
- Reply threads with show/hide toggle
- Event delegation for efficient click handling
- Unique tweet IDs generated with UUID
- Dynamic rendering from a data module

## How It Works

- Tweets are stored in a local data array
- User interactions update tweet state (likes, retweets, replies)
- The feed re-renders after each interaction
- No backend, authentication, or database is used

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6 Modules)
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Font Awesome Icons
- UUID for unique tweet IDs
